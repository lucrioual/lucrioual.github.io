			<div style="display:inline-block">1) Since 2017 and the publication of her first book, <em>Conversations with Friends</em>, Rooney has been one of, if not the, most discussed and written about young novelists today. Not only does she outsell the majority of her peers&mdash;"literary fiction" a term most liable to use under the headline of "I know it when I see it," though more generally befitting low print runs&mdash;she also dominates the space held for critical appraisal. On April 27, 2021, about five months before the publication of the book, I read an essay about Sally Rooney that I found wanting, and wrote the following email to several friends, which is arguably the germ of this essay . . . And so I thought, where could this lead that is more interesting than another screed? What would it look like to review all the reviews of Sally Rooney’s <em>Beautiful World, Where Are You</em> without ever reading the book? (from page 17 & 19)

				<br>
				<br>
			2) Much like my idea for <em>The John</em>, an essay about the reviews of a book I had not read just seemed funny, and I’ve refused to break off from the bit. While I felt confident I could take the experience and from it make a (somewhat) cohesive piece of writing, I did not feel confident any publication would take on such a silly idea from someone without a name to warrant the energy and space it would need . . . I was six months&mdash;now [two] a year[s]&mdash;into querying The John and the absence of bureaucracy married to its immediacy made a zine feel, once again, liberating. When I was 19, I printed the first of thirteen zines I would make over a period of four years, an exercise that began out of a belayed inclination, the day I dropped out of college, to drown myself in the pond near where I grew up. They consisted of poems and stories in which I tried to give form to a feeling I have yet to kick&mdash;here’s how I phrase it in the novel, giving the narrator my feeling: "that somewhere in the pine groves and parking lots of our youth I somehow missed the secret everyone else was told"&mdash;denied the wonderful gift of enough self assurance to get by on suspicions alone. What I hoped to replicate, here, was the access I had, then, to an urgency, a fearlessness, an indifference to how I might be judged while I lingered there, on the upswing from suicide.
